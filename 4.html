No matter how clear the great need for artificial intelligence is, we are still at the beginning of need and investment, because the future is great, and dependence on it will be almost entirely gradually, and this is what specialists always see. I looked for the views of those interested in the field, and gathered some of opinions of the specialists, published through the topic "dazzling expectations about the future of artificial intelligence", as follows:
According to Peter Appel, a computing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, artificial intelligence will help predict disasters, fight aging, address traffic accidents and deaths, and help prevent nuclear disasters, as happened at Fukushima Power Station.
Oren Etzioni, executive director of the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, believes that many human dreams, such as space travel and the elimination of diseases and deadly viruses, may be achieved in the science of artificial intelligence, which will succeed in answering many human questions.
Matthew Taylor, a computer scientist at Washington University, believes that AI applications will help elderly and people with special needs. Home robots can help people in daily life activities such as making sure to take medication, help them prepare their food, and help them exercise, move, and track their daily activities. And implement medical and treatment advice.
